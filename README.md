# ALL-Detection-Using-CNN
Acute Lymbhoblastic Luekemia is a blood malignancy which affects the WBCs.We have come up with an automated system, which aims to reduce the time constraints and the 
give maximum accuracy by using Convolutional Nueral Networks(Deep Learning !). We first segment the cancer cells and then the normal cells. Then we undergo further classification
to seperate the L1, L2, and L3 forms of cancer cells (According to FAB classification).
